#Overview

Cloudbrain is a platform for real-time sensor data analysis and visualization.
<br>
One type of sensor data that works well with cloudbrain is EEG data. [EEG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography) is the recording of electrical activity along the scalp. In other words, brainwaves.
<br>
<br>
Cloudbrain enables you to:
- **Stream sensor data** into a central database.
- **Analyze sensor data** to find spatial and temporal patterns.
- **Visualize sensor data** and patterns in real-time.
